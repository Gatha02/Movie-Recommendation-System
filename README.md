To build a movie recommendation system using cosine similarity, you'll start by training your model in Jupyter Notebook. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in a 
multi-dimensional space, making it an effective method for comparing user preferences or movie attributes. You can train your model using a dataset such as the MovieLens dataset, which contains user ratings and 
metadata about movies. By creating a matrix where rows represent movies and columns represent features (like genres or user ratings), you calculate the cosine similarity between these vectors. This helps determine 
which movies are most similar to a given one, enabling recommendations based on similarity.

Once the data is processed and the cosine similarity model is ready, you can integrate this logic into a Streamlit app for real-time interaction. Streamlit is a Python-based framework that makes it easy to build 
interactive web applications. By importing your pre-trained model from Jupyter Notebook into your app (developed in PyCharm), you can design an interface where users select a movie, and the app fetches and displays 
recommendations. You can add input widgets like dropdown menus for movie selection and sliders for adjusting parameters like similarity thresholds. The results can be displayed in a visually appealing table or list 
format, enriched with movie posters and descriptions for better engagement.

PyCharm serves as the integrated development environment (IDE) for coding and deploying the app. It supports Streamlit integration and ensures efficient debugging and project management. The overall workflow 
involves using Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and model training, exporting the trained model, and then using Streamlit in PyCharm to create an accessible and elegant user interface. This setup balances 
robust data analysis with a sleek, user-friendly app for recommending movies, making it suitable for both developers and end-users.
